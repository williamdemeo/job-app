    {The Lambda Calculus and Dependent Type Theory} %January 23 at 2pm
    {Boulder, CO 2018}
    {University of Colorado Logic Seminar}
%% Abstract: The first in a two-part series on the Lean proof assistant, this lecture introduces the mathematics of functional programming, namely, the lambda calculus.  The second lecture will give a basic introduction to Lean, a relatively new addition to the growing family of functional programming languages.  Lean improves upon earlier proof assistants by making it more natural and less painful to formalize mathematical proofs.
