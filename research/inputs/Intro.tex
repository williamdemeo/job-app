Universal algebra has been invigorated in recent years by new collaborations
with theoretical computer scientists and graph theorists. Algebraic theories born thirty
years ago have turned out to be broadly applicable in obtaining deep and
definitive results on the computational complexity of algorithmic
problems in the broad class of constraint satisfaction problems.
We call this area \emph{algebraic \acs{CSP} theory}. Here the tools of universal
algebra, combined with combinatorial reasoning about polymorphisms
(multi-variable endomorphisms) acting on finite graphs and other relational
structures, has produced new results determining the complexity of various
types of \ac{CSP}, and has explained and united most of the older results. 
Dually, nearly all of these new results have been turned around and used to
produce startling new algebraic results.\\[4pt]
